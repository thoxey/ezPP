## ezPPTesting ##
Unit tests and benchmarks made with QT test to make sure everthing is running fine and efficiently.    
The tests to the library are fairly mundane, but they are useful to enure that when tinkering nothing has gone astray. Given the type of library most of the the unit tests we can run are this kind of test.   
However the tests also debug all of the shader code using an adapted version of the shder debugger that you will find in the **ShaderDebugger** folder.
Testing whether library's core funtion is working are the visual tests that the user performs whenever they run it, and therefore that is hard to write unit tests for.
